            <p class= "pcontentleft">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My name is Selena Lin.
                 I attend Perry Meridian High School and will graduate in May of 2024.
                 I am the oldest of three and is often found responsible of not
                 letting my siblings go wild. Prior experience that I have had so far
                 in the work force is with the family restuarant we used to have.
                 Basically every waking hour not spent in school was spent in the
                 restuarant. My responsibilities there included cleaning tables and
                 supplies when I was younger and taking orders and acting as cashier
                 when I was a bit older. That experience made me realize the hardships
                 of running a business, the struggles of communication with customers,
                 and how important budgeting and time management is. It also taught me
                 that sometimes it is necessary to be stubborn and persistent, especially
                 when malicious landlords want to cheat us of a $3,000 walk-in fridge.</p>

                 student and also partake in the Early College program offered
                 by Vincennes University. AP classes I have taken so far include
                 World History: Modern, United States History, Calculus AB, English
                 Literature, and Seminar. Scorewise, I have recieved 4s and 5s.
                 I am planning on taking AP Spanish, English Language, Computer
                 Science A, Calculus BC, and Research senior year. Dual credit
                 classes I have taken include Spanish II-IV, Biology, and Speech.
                 I tend to be much more interested in STEM classes and hope to
                 go to college for computer science, mathematics, or business.</p>

            <p class= "pcontentleft">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I never really
                 thought that I would get into coding and software development
                 because there was always the thought that computers and technology
                 is something for guys and guy dominate the industry. Even after
                 seeing my second cousin code for his homework in college at Purdue,
                 I still did not think of it as something I can do. What changed
                 is that the computer science teacher at Perry also taught Dar/Comp,
                 a class I had to take freshman year. My schedule for sophomore year
                 was going to have study halls that I did not want and I decided to
                 take more of that teacher's classes, which happened to be Intro to CS.

            <p class="pcontentright">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In Intro, I was
                 introduced to JavaScript as well as some HTML and CSS. Some
                 of the projects I made in that class include an e-card and
                 some simple games. In junior year, I took Computer Science
                 and was introduced to Python. There was a lot more projects
                 and figuring out how to code some pre-existing functions
                 like .sort() and .reverse for lists/arrays. It is also
                 when I was introduced to the Catapult program. One of my friends
                 was a Catapult for the summer of 2022 and took me along to one
                 of the Catapult + One events. It was really fun (we won the
                 catapult making competition) and I was really excited to be
                 a part of the 2023 cohort.</p>

                 is felt deeply about, which for me, is having windows.
                 This is mostly because it gets very suffocating at Perry
                 somethings because most of the classrooms I am in have no

                 being based on combinations of answers the user inputs
                 for two questions. User input was quite difficult to
